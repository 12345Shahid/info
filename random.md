üí° Coming Soon: Faster AI, Audio, Video, Image, and specialised tools for specific niches.

üëâ Start Chatting for Free Now!

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of our features:

**Functionality 1: we are going to use mistral which is an open source LLM model like mistral and we are going to use the 7B version I guess[ in case it is going to have five categories of tools and they are blog tool to YouTube tool, research tool, programming tool, general tool ]


When a new user signs up, they should automatically receive 20 free credits. These credits are given for opening a new account and allow users to create outputs using any of the blog, YouTube, or programming tools. Users can manually edit their outputs as much as they want, but if they want the AI to edit the response based on edit requirements, they‚Äôll need another credit. After signing up, users will receive a notification about the free credits. Once used up, users can earn more credits, but more information about this is available on the pricing page. If users try to use any tool after exhausting their credits, they‚Äôll receive a message indicating that they need to earn or renew credits. To do this, they should visit the pricing page for a detailed explanation.

Let‚Äôs move on to the website pages.

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of the pages I need you to design:

**Homepage:** I want a clean and professional homepage, but I‚Äôm open to ideas. Copy.AI and Gravity have great designs that I like. If you can follow their lead, that would be awesome. The homepage should include a section for our available features, such as our powerful AI models and upcoming tools. This information is available in the website description I sent earlier.

**About Us:** Create a page with a website description as content. Feel free to add other relevant information.

**Contact:** Design a standard contact page in case make a contact for and I am going to use supabase for this 
**Notifications:** Build a standard notification page with a matching colour palette to the website. I am going to use supabase for this .

**Profile:** just design a standard profile page. Add a menu to all pages, including this one. Some fields will be automatically filled in with registration information.

**Pricings:** it should only include the text below

We don‚Äôt follow traditional pricing. Instead, you‚Äôll share our website and earn credits. You can use these credits to create content.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

Let‚Äôs say there are two users, user1 and user2. User1 shares our website with a unique link. When user1 gets this link, they get one credit because someone signed up using their link.

If user2 earns credits by sharing or watching ads, user1 gets the same amount of credit automatically. For example, if user2 shares with five people and gets five credits, user1 gets five credits too, even though they didn‚Äôt do anything. This is because user2 came from user1‚Äôs referral link.

One credit can generate content from any of our tools or platforms, like a token for creating a blog, video, or audio. You can have one output from any tool under any category.

Share our website with your unique link to earn unlimited credits and create unlimited content daily.

We aim to build a community of Halal content creators. Please share our website to help you find and create Halal information.

 dashboard:

Here‚Äôs an example dashboard with four sections:

- Total credits for generating content.
- Credits earned by referring the website.
- Credits earned by watching ads.
- Recent activity, including a list of content generated in the last two months.

The menu should be on the right side of the page and match the homepage‚Äôs colour palette.



Build a standard authentication page with best practices. If the page‚Äôs colour palette matches the website‚Äôs, do that for consistency. I‚Äôm using the free supabase authentication service.

Enable cookie settings and add terms and conditions and a privacy policy page. People will agree to them while signing up. Write the content in the terms and privacy policy pages, aligning it with my website. If you need more directions, create standard pages and follow best practices. Also add language changing option.

The chatbot interface can be simple and use a friendly . You can make the design  

Include input fields like a negative box for users to specify what they don‚Äôt want in the generated content, a word range (e.g., 1500 to 2500), and a tone (e.g., excited, professional). Add any other input fields you think are beneficial. Aim for maximum user satisfaction by providing all possible input fields so users can customise the content. Also, include output fields as desired, but keep in mind that the tool will generate text, so there should be enough manual editing options in the interface after generation about manual editing people is going to click on the content and they will be taken to a separate page which will be like Google Docs for editing the content. In case there will be a tool selection page and people can access that using the menu and in that page people can find the five categories of tools . People can choose any of the tool and then he will be redirected to that  tool interface and then he will start chatting and generating. There will be  five types of tools and they are blogging tool ,YouTube tool, research tool, developer tool, general tool . As you can understand all the tools interfaces will have some similarities like the colour palette as they belong to the same website but yes, they will have different also because they are different. 

Now, let‚Äôs move on to the back-end functionalities.


1. In the dashboard description, I mentioned three top sections and one for user credit sharing. Let‚Äôs say two users, user1 and user2, share the website. If user1 gets a unique link from user2, they get one credit for a user signing up. If user2 earns credits by sharing or watching ads, user1 gets the same. For instance, if user2 shares to five and gets five credits, user1 gets five without effort. One credit generates one output from any tool, like a blog, paragraph, story, or research paper. I need a mechanism for this. Let me know if you need external APIs or anything. It‚Äôd be better if you built it yourself.

2. We are going to use mistral from hugging face and I have gave the token for hugging face in the required file so you should check it and continue. 


3. History. You may see in the dashboard and also in the chatbot interface that there is an option to see the history and the history should be saved so I need that mechanism at the back end also.

4. File Management. There should be an option in the menu and also after anyone generates any content from the tools he should see this option and it is called file management( at the menu) or save ( at the tool/chatbot interface) . He should be able to save the work or the content he generated and he should be able to create folders and files under these folders and he will also be able to create file without any folder and it is like a standard file manager or I should say not complex but yeah it's like a normal file manager. I also want a search engine there, which will help the user to search among the files and folders. There should be also filters in the search engine. In case he will use the filter to search only folders or to search only files across the whole file manager functionality ( Suppose someone searched for SS. And if he uses a filter to only see the files then he should see the file SS which is under a folder and he will also see any file which is close to his search keyword even if it is not under any folder. )  And user should be able to download a file or a folder separately. and if he wants to download all the files and folders then he will have an option in the dashboard called Export to CSV and if he downloads files separately as a file then he will have several options like PDF or PPT.


5. The chats or the conversations should be shareable and people should be able to mark some of them as favourite as they wish. You should handle this in both places frontend  and back end.


In short  this is like a simple website like ChatGPT but it will generate the content which is halal by the rules of Islam. For example, if someone enters a question and hits the create or  generate button then the AI will check the prompt that if it is halal or not if the user asked to generate something Haram then it will show the user a beautiful notification that your given prompt is Haram so I can't generate it and it will highlight the point that why it is Haram with a good explanation and the text highlighting where the problem caused . And when it will generate the content  It will also make sure that it is generating content which is halal by the rules of Islam.



The  ai should be able to create files, pies, charts and tables as needed


6.  Another thing is that I guess I told you before that I want a menu and that menu should be in the top right corner of the navigation bar and visible in all the pages and this man who will contain all the pages of the website now there is a thing called dynamic URL routing. What I want is that there will be only three pages public which are about us ,contact us, pricing. Now suppose someone came to the homepage and he's not logged in and he clicked on the menu then he saw all the pages and he clicked on profile. Then he will be redirected to the login page and after logging in he will be redirected to the profile page directly.. now if he don't have any account then he can open one by signing up using email and password and the login page will contain link to the signup page and the signup page will contain link to the login page which is very standard. 

And yes, this is the hugging face access token or API key whatever I tell it               HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=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


https://replit.com/@shahidhasanpoll/ProjectPlannerPro-Would-you-like-me-to-clarify-a-few-thing





This is the first version of the web application. We can go deeper, but first we need to deal with that. And yes, I have already created a .env.local file and in that file you will find all the required tokens from third-party services and I have created a SQL file which tells all the SQL queries I have used in the SQL editor of spabase for setting up this project and you can also take a look at that so that you don't repeat anything and I guess all the necessary queries for file management, history and dashboard is already done but you can also check it.



Below some extra features what we can add to take our web application in the next version, but first we will complete the first version.

Dear Content Runners 

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Shahid Hasan, and I am the founder of¬†Edu.1 Bangladesh , a growing online platform dedicated to empowering students in Bangladesh by providing educational resources and writing opportunities.

I am reaching out to explore a potential collaboration where students from our community can contribute writing projects for your company, similar to the services offered by ProWritersTime. Our site attracts enthusiastic and capable young writers eager to gain experience and earn through quality writing assignments.

I believe this partnership could provide a mutually beneficial opportunity: you would gain access to a motivated pool of writers, and our students would benefit from real-world writing experience and financial support.

Would you be interested in discussing this further? I would be happy to share more details about our audience and how we can facilitate a smooth collaboration.

Thank you for considering this opportunity. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,‚Ä®Shahid Hasan‚Ä®shahidhasanpollob@gmail.com



Create a website for my sass company . It works on almost all the services related with computer science and very specialised for AI. Create authentication system with password reset functionality. It will be a static website. It will only have the homepage the , AI startup page. And a contact page. Nothing else.  In case the name of the website is createHalal and as I said before it is a software company so write a description for it and we build things with alliance with the rules of Islam. It doesn't means that we build things Islamic rather we don't just build things which are Haram by the rules of Islam. That's it. And below is the email ID to keep in the contact page as a contact number 




create.contact.369@gmail.com



Supabase url     https://hqdlqogacwovunmvgvmq.supabase.co
Supabase public/anon key      eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImhxZGxxb2dhY3dvdnVubXZndm1xIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDU0MDAyMDIsImV4cCI6MjA2MDk3NjIwMn0.fZIWLcnyr5PpWrMTF0oLfEst-lkATpA4iZ8PPUFcrWE




In case use this for authentication if there is anything necessary.





In the pricing page there will be three pricings. I mean, this is not the pricing page. I'm sorry it should be the AI startup page. In this page there will be three pricing firstly is the basic which is the $3 per month. For this, they will have access to one AI model from any model. Doesn't matter what model they use they will have to provide $2 for the API and then they can pay more as they wish. And  it will give them a completely functional website. With the functionality is below


Access to any of the AI model with free three month usage unlimitedly . Secondly, authentication and database support and a fully deployed website. And up to 5 chat interfaces as they want to create different categories of chats in their website so they will tell us and we will give. And basic  ui customisation. [Like about the description of their project, but it is not so much. ] they will also get 24 seven pro level customer support. And also little functionalities like dark and light mode, copying ai response. It will also have other necessary pages like about us, pricings, contact. The user will give description about this and he will get static pages, not dynamic pages or something very crucial functionality. Dashboard functionality for tracking credits will be also added.





Okay, there will be another with $12 plan. They will get everything in the $3 plan which is called starter and this one is called the business plan. And also they will get some things below.


They can choose as many models as they wish in their website from any model as they wish and they will have notification functionality. And they will also have a project/file management functionality. And up to 15 chat interfaces and functionality for categorising them. Also, they will have functionality to customise the UI more like choosing the colour codes and the font and they can also add images as inspiration for their website. And yes, they will use API's for multiple models and they will not need to give API fee rather we will give them $2 API fee for free.











hey I have a website for learning things for Bangladeshi students and it is a powered and instead of taking money I want to give them some jobs while they will do the job and I will get the money and they will not need subscription for my website. Tell me about any website or company where they provide people jobs and they have API which I can access without any money for listing the jobs in my website for the students and after the work is done I will get the money. keep in mind that I don't have any money and don't tell me about anything like up work because this one has API but it is very tough to get that. and even if it needs money then also tell me I am sorry I guess I have some money I forgot about it so tell me but in some places it is tough to get and don't tell that. try to target things like data entry, transcription, transcribe I mean the jobs which doesn't need so much experience but I don't mean everything like that it can be anything from designing to writing. anything which can be done online just make sure they have API which is accessible

Subject: Proposal for Strategic Collaboration with CreateHalal Softwares Limited
Dear Appen Team,

I hope you‚Äôre doing well. I‚Äôm reaching out to explore a potential collaboration between Appen and our company as we prepare to launch a new freelance marketplace tailored for efficiency, affordability, and added value to workers.

Our platform aims to not only offer freelance job opportunities but also provide our workers with subscriptions to various platforms and software tools‚Äîincluding our own proprietary solutions‚Äîas part of their compensation. We would like to integrate Appen‚Äôs job listings into our marketplace using your API, enabling us to post pre-existing jobs from your platform directly to ours.

Here‚Äôs where the collaboration becomes mutually beneficial: tasks typically priced at $10 on Appen could be completed on our platform at just $5, while still maintaining full accuracy and quality. We would handle the worker payments based on our internal policy, and your team would continue to benefit from task completion at reduced costs.

We believe this partnership could be highly valuable for both sides, In sha Allah, and would love to schedule a meeting to discuss the opportunity in more detail. Please let us know a convenient time for you.

Looking forward to your response.

Warm regards,
Shahid Hasan

Project saas


Create a website for my sass company . It works on almost all the services related with computer science and very specialised for AI. Create authentication system with password reset functionality. It will be a static website. It will only have the homepage the , AI startup page. And a contact page. Nothing else.  In case the name of the website is createHalal and as I said before it is a software company so write a description for it and we build things with alliance with the rules of Islam. It doesn't means that we build things Islamic rather we don't just build things which are Haram by the rules of Islam. That's it. And below is the email ID to keep in the contact page as a contact number 




create.contact.369@gmail.com



Supabase url     https://hqdlqogacwovunmvgvmq.supabase.co
Supabase public/anon key      eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImhxZGxxb2dhY3dvdnVubXZndm1xIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDU0MDAyMDIsImV4cCI6MjA2MDk3NjIwMn0.fZIWLcnyr5PpWrMTF0oLfEst-lkATpA4iZ8PPUFcrWE




In case use this for authentication if there is anything necessary.





In the pricing page there will be three pricings. I mean, this is not the pricing page. I'm sorry it should be the AI startup page. In this page there will be three pricing firstly is the basic which is the $3 per month. For this, they will have access to one AI model from any model. Doesn't matter what model they use they will have to provide $2 for the API and then they can pay more as they wish. And  it will give them a completely functional website. With the functionality is below


Access to any of the AI model with free three month usage unlimitedly . Secondly, authentication and database support and a fully deployed website. And up to 5 chat interfaces as they want to create different categories of chats in their website so they will tell us and we will give. And basic  ui customisation. [Like about the description of their project, but it is not so much. ] they will also get 24 seven pro level customer support. And also little functionalities like dark and light mode, copying ai response. It will also have other necessary pages like about us, pricings, contact. The user will give description about this and he will get static pages, not dynamic pages or something very crucial functionality. Dashboard functionality for tracking credits will be also added.





Okay, there will be another with $12 plan. They will get everything in the $3 plan which is called starter and this one is called the business plan. And also they will get some things below.


They can choose as many models as they wish in their website from any model as they wish and they will have notification functionality. And they will also have a project/file management functionality. And up to 15 chat interfaces and functionality for categorising them. Also, they will have functionality to customise the UI more like choosing the colour codes and the font and they can also add images as inspiration for their website. And yes, they will use API's for multiple models and they will not need to give API fee rather we will give them $2 API fee for free.

* Ethical Focus: Pre-embedded system prompts align with growing demand for responsible AI.
Challenges
1. Hardware Limitations:
    * Mac M2 (8GB RAM) can handle ~1,000 requests/day for Qwen-7B. Scaling to 10k+ requests requires optimized models (e.g., GGUF quantization).
    * Solution: Use TinyLlama or Phi-3 (3B-parameter models) for higher throughput.
2. Decentralization Risks:
    * Peer-hosted nodes may have inconsistent uptime.
    * Solution: Hybrid architecture (combine peer nodes with a small central cluster for reliability).
3. Monetization:
    * Charging $5‚Äì$9/month is feasible if operational costs are <$0.50/user (achievable with lightweight models).

* Target Audience: Startups in Bangladesh/South Asia needing affordable AI APIs (validated by platforms like CrossRoads Initiative9).
* Competitors: Hugging Face offers 30k free tokens/month, but your platform‚Äôs ‚Äúhigh-rate + ethics‚Äù angle differentiates it.
MVP Roadmap Adjustments
* Phase 1: Start with a centralized MVP (hosted on your hardware) to validate demand before decentralizing.
* Phase 3: Use FastAPI for the gateway but add auth via OAuth2 (e.g., Auth0 free tier).
Final Verdict
* MIT Prep: Focus on IOI/BdMO, MIT OCW courses, and SAT prep (1520+ target).
* Project: Viable for niche markets (e.g., Bangladeshi startups) with phased scaling. Start with a centralized MVP and iterate.

Strategic Project Development for Scholarship and Career Advancement in Software Engineering
As a Bangladeshi student preparing for undergraduate scholarships in Computer Science while building a competitive profile for internships and employment, developing targeted technical projects is crucial. Below are two comprehensive Django project ideas designed to enhance both scholarship applications and job/internship opportunities, along with an analysis of AI portfolio builders.

Project 1: Automated Job Portal with Web Scraping and Dynamic Filtering
Technical Architecture
This project combines Django‚Äôs backend capabilities with MongoDB for NoSQL data storage and PostgreSQL for relational user management. The system scrapes job listings from platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed using Python‚Äôs Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries23, then applies machine learning models to filter opportunities based on user preferences (e.g., salary ranges, location, skill requirements).
Key Features
1. Dual Database Integration:
    * PostgreSQL: Manages user authentication, profile data, and application tracking using Django‚Äôs built-in ORM3.
    * MongoDB: Stores unstructured scraped job data (e.g., raw HTML, JSON responses) for efficient querying of large datasets1.
    * Data synchronization between databases is achieved through Django signals and celery tasks.
2. Web Scraping Engine:‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®python‚Ä®‚Ä®# Example Selenium script for LinkedIn scraping  
3. from selenium import webdriver  
4. from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand  
5. 
6. class Command(BaseCommand):  
7.     def handle(self, *args, **options):  
8.         driver = webdriver.Chrome()  
9.         driver.get("https://linkedin.com/jobs")  
10.         jobs = driver.find_elements_by_class_name("job-card-container")  
11.         for job in jobs:  
12.             title = job.find_element_by_class_name("job-title").text  
13.             company = job.find_element_by_class_name("company-name").text  
14.             # Save to MongoDB  
15.             JobListing.objects.using('mongodb').create(title=title, company=company)  
16. ‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®This modular design allows scraping multiple platforms concurrently2.
17. ML-Powered Recommendation System:
    * Implements a cosine similarity algorithm to match user profiles with job requirements:
18. similarity‚Ä®=‚Ä®A‚Ä®‚ãÖ‚Ä®B‚Ä®‚Ä®‚à•‚Ä®A‚Ä®‚à•‚Ä®‚à•‚Ä®B‚Ä®‚à•‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®\text{similarity} = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{\|\mathbf{A}\| \|\mathbf{B}\|}‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®similarity=‚à•A‚à•‚à•B‚à•A‚ãÖB where A‚Ä®‚Ä®\mathbf{A}‚Ä®‚Ä®A and B‚Ä®‚Ä®\mathbf{B}‚Ä®‚Ä®B are TF-IDF vectors of user skills and job descriptions3.
19. Scholarship-Oriented Features:
    * Integration with government scholarship portals (e.g., DAAD, MEXT) via their APIs.
    * Deadline tracking with automated email reminders using Django‚Äôs send_mail() and celery beat4.
Impact on Career/Scholarship Applications
* Technical Showcase: Demonstrates full-stack development, database optimization, and API integration‚Äîskills directly mentioned in internship postings24.
* Scholarship Relevance: Highlights problem-solving abilities through real-world data processing challenges, aligning with research-oriented scholarship criteria.

Project 2: Academic Project Tracker with Collaborative Features
System Design
A Django-based platform where students can propose, manage, and showcase academic projects, incorporating both SQL (for structured data) and MongoDB (for document storage of project artifacts).
Core Components
1. Multi-Model Database Setup:
    * PostgreSQL: Stores user profiles, project metadata, and collaboration history.
    * MongoDB: Archives project files (code, datasets), version histories, and discussion threads.
2. Real-Time Collaboration:
    * Uses Django Channels and WebSockets for instant messaging and code collaboration3.
    * Implements operational transformation (OT) algorithms for concurrent document editing:
3. apply‚Ä®(‚Ä®OT‚Ä®(‚Ä®d‚Ä®o‚Ä®c‚Ä®u‚Ä®m‚Ä®e‚Ä®n‚Ä®t‚Ä®,‚Ä®o‚Ä®p‚Ä®e‚Ä®r‚Ä®a‚Ä®t‚Ä®i‚Ä®o‚Ä®n‚Ä®)‚Ä®,‚Ä®n‚Ä®e‚Ä®w‚Ä®_‚Ä®o‚Ä®p‚Ä®e‚Ä®r‚Ä®a‚Ä®t‚Ä®i‚Ä®o‚Ä®n‚Ä®)‚Ä®=‚Ä®merged_operation‚Ä®‚Ä®\text{apply}(\text{OT}(document, operation), new\_operation) = \text{merged\_operation}‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®apply(OT(document,operation),new_operation)=merged_operation
4. Scholarship Portfolio Builder:
    * Automatically generates project summaries in LaTeX format for scholarship applications.
    * Integrates with Overleaf API for direct submission.
5. Analytics Dashboard:
    * Tracks project impact metrics (GitHub stars, citations) using the GitHub GraphQL API.
    * Visualizes data with Plotly.js:
6. ‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®xml‚Ä®‚Ä®<div id="chart">{{ plot_div|safe }}</div>

For now immediately open a sub account for me and share the access so that I can access tha okay, as I said in the post that I need someone who can manage my clientsWe can start righAs I said before, in the post that I need someone who can manage my clients in multiple sub accounts, each sub account for one client for now immediately open a sub account for me and share the access so that I can access that. Another reason of saying that is that  many people do fraud, they tell me that they can work, but if I tell them to, but if I tell them to perform any action, then they can't do that  so I want to see that you are legit my friend.





Oh, and also tell me if you need any information to share the access like email or phone number or something else t now, but as I said in the post that I need someone who can manage my clients in multiples of accounts, each for one client for . For now immediately open a sub account for me and share the access so that I can access that



Hey, I was running this campaign on behalf of my client, and I just need some clear answers to three quick questions. That‚Äôs all ‚Äî nothing complicated. Based on your answers, we‚Äôll decide how to move forward depending on specific client needs.



1Ô∏è‚É£ First Scenario:



A private clinic in Dubai wants a sub-account. You‚Äôll just need to open the sub-account and share access with their staff (no agency-level access needed). You won‚Äôt need to manage anything ‚Äî just give access.

üîπ How much would you charge for this?

üî∏ Is it a one-time fee or monthly? (Monthly is often preferred by our clients. Tell me that how much will you charge if it is monthly, then tell me how much do you want monthly, and if it is one time to tell me how much it is for one time that's it.)



[ another important note for this scenario is that our clients mostly pay between $20-$25 for this first scenario, because in this case you need to do nothing, just create a sub account and share the access]





2Ô∏è‚É£ Second Scenario:



A restaurant in Moka, Saudi Arabia wants you to open and fully manage a sub-account based on their needs.

üîπ How much would you charge monthly for full management?

üî∏ Or would you prefer to charge hourly?

Feel free to give rates for both options (monthly vs hourly support).



3Ô∏è‚É£ Assistance/Consultation:



Sometimes, a client may only need occasional support or consultancy ‚Äî like screen sharing and quick guidance for a few hours.

üîπ What would be your hourly rate for that kind of help?



Most of our clients are from rich Middle Eastern countries, with a few from India and elsewhere. A lower rate at the start could bring more clients, which might be a smart move for long-term growth ‚Äî but of course, pricing is your call.



I already have your contact details, just need your payment info for our database. Looking forward to your clear answers so we can potentially move forward with client requests.







Just give me the answers and don‚Äôt worry, you can make little changes if you want later so don‚Äôt worry just give an estimated rate so that we can store in the database and lock any project which matches in the screening process with your rates

Just keep in mind two things firstly that most of the clients we get are from the rich countries from Middle East and some of them are from other places like India and other places across the world and a higher rate will give you less clients but a lower rate at the beginning will give you a lot of clients which maybe will be good for you to grow in the future as you have clients. Which leads to a potential growth in the future. But yes it's obviously your choice. And I just need to store all the information in our database for the marketers who joined us from this campaign.

Keep in mind that in the first question the assistance means consultancy and in the second question the assistance means working as a marketer for managing the complete cycle so the charges for both won‚Äôt be the same. The first one is just telling somebody like a community helping[ which is quite very simple in case somebody can share the screen and perform a few task according to your instructions and you will be paid per hour] and the second one is managing. If you align with these answers, then we can go forward according to any specific client requirements
You sent
And the second question is that suppose there is a client who has a restaurant in Moka Saudi Arabia and he wants you to open a sub account and also manage that account according to his needs and instructions as he don‚Äôt have a worker for managing that. How much will you charge per month for this? Or do you charge per hour? And and you can tell me separate pricing for if somebody wants to book you for the complete month or once your assistant for some hours in the month and you can tell pricing for both of these.

# Payment Solutions and Business Model Analysis for Bangladesh

Based on your three distinct questions, I'll provide comprehensive analysis for each business opportunity and technical solution.

---

## **Question 1: Paying for GoHighLevel and Similar Platforms from Bangladesh**

### **Current Payment Challenges**

GoHighLevel exclusively accepts credit and debit cards for payment, which creates significant barriers for Bangladeshi users [6]. The platform uses Stripe as its primary payment processor, and Stripe currently rejects cards from many countries including Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Cambodia due to fraud prevention and regulatory restrictions [1][5].

### **Available Payment Solutions**

#### **Immediate Options**
- **Prepaid International Cards**: Jamuna Bank offers Visa prepaid cards in both local currency and US dollars, which can be used for international e-commerce transactions with 3-D security [13]. These dual currency cards are specifically designed for overseas payments and online services.
- **UCB Dual Currency Debit Cards**: United Commercial Bank provides Visa and Mastercard debit cards that work internationally, though they require USD endorsement on your passport for foreign currency transactions [33].

#### **Upcoming Solution: Google Pay**
Google Pay is officially launching in Bangladesh within the next month, as announced by government advisers [8][10]. The service will initially be available to City Bank customers and will support Visa/Mastercard integration, including Bangladeshi Taka cards [14]. This could potentially solve payment issues for platforms that integrate with Google Pay, though GoHighLevel's current integration with Google Pay remains unclear [11].

### **Long-term Payment Strategy**
For sustainable access to international SaaS platforms, consider establishing relationships with payment intermediaries or agencies that specialize in international transactions for Bangladeshi businesses. However, no specific companies were identified that offer this service comprehensively.

---

## **Question 2: Payment Intermediary Business Model**

### **Business Concept Viability**

Your proposed payment intermediary service - acting as a bridge between Bangladeshi users and international payment systems - is technically feasible but requires careful legal and regulatory consideration.

#### **Multiple Card Infrastructure**
Yes, banks in Bangladesh do offer add-on or supplementary cards. For example, major banks allow 2-4 additional cards per primary account [38]. However, using multiple cards across different Stripe or PayPal accounts may violate these platforms' terms of service regarding account multiplication [22].

### **Regulatory Requirements**

#### **Bangladesh Compliance**
The Payment and Settlement System Act, 2024 requires all payment service providers to obtain approval from Bangladesh Bank [36]. Companies operating payment services without proper licensing face up to 5 years imprisonment and BDT 5 million in fines [17].

#### **Licensing Requirements**
To operate legally, you would need:
- Payment Service Provider license from Bangladesh Bank
- Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT) procedures
- Sound financial background with segregated customer funds
- Robust governance arrangements [17]

### **Business Model Structure**
Your agent-based model resembles existing payment processing agent networks. Agents typically earn commissions ranging from 1-3% of transaction fees, and the payment industry supports such intermediary models [35].

### **Market Potential**
**Global Market Size**: The payment intermediary market is substantial, driven by cross-border payment challenges. Similar models have succeeded in other emerging markets where traditional payment methods face restrictions.

**Revenue Potential**: With proper execution, this could generate significant revenue through:
- Transaction fees (2-5% per transaction)
- Monthly service fees for agents
- Volume-based commission structures

### **Startup Costs**
Based on similar payment platform developments:
- **Platform Development**: $50,000-$150,000 for a robust system [28]
- **Regulatory Compliance**: $5,000-$20,000 for licenses and permits [28]
- **Technology Infrastructure**: $10,000-$40,000 for payment processing tools [28]
- **Total Estimated Cost**: $100,000-$250,000 for a comprehensive solution

---

## **Question 3: Software Subscription Marketplace**

### **Business Model Analysis**

Creating a marketplace for reselling software subscriptions (like GoHighLevel's unlimited sub-accounts) is a proven business model with strong market demand.

#### **GoHighLevel Reselling Opportunity**
GoHighLevel's Agency Unlimited plan ($497/month) provides unlimited sub-accounts that can be resold individually [21]. This creates arbitrage opportunities where you can sell sub-accounts for $50-100/month while maintaining healthy profit margins [21].

### **Market Demand Assessment**
**Market Size**: The software reseller market is substantial, with companies reducing time-to-market by up to 60% using reseller solutions [29]. The white-label SaaS marketplace has become particularly vibrant, with businesses seeking cost-effective alternatives to custom development.

**Target Customers**: 
- Small agencies unable to afford full GoHighLevel plans
- Freelancers needing basic CRM functionality
- Startups requiring affordable marketing automation tools

### **Technical Requirements for Marketplace**

#### **Development Costs**
- **Basic Marketplace Platform**: $5,000-$120,000 depending on complexity [26]
- **No-Code Solutions**: Starting from $49/month with platforms like Shipturtle [24]
- **Custom Development**: $10,000-$50,000 for MVP version [27]

#### **Essential Features**
- User registration and subscription management
- Payment processing integration
- API connections to software providers
- Access control and user provisioning
- Billing and usage tracking systems [27]

### **Comparative Analysis: Which Business is Better?**

| Aspect | Payment Intermediary | Software Marketplace |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Startup Cost** | $100,000-$250,000 | $10,000-$50,000 |
| **Time to Market** | 12-18 months (due to licensing) | 3-6 months |
| **Regulatory Complexity** | Very High | Low-Medium |
| **Revenue Potential** | Very High (Global scale) | High (Software-specific) |
| **Market Entry Barrier** | High (Legal/Financial) | Low-Medium |

### **Recommendation**

**Start with the Software Marketplace** for these reasons:
1. **Lower Entry Costs**: Requires 5-10x less initial investment
2. **Faster Implementation**: Can be operational within 3-6 months
3. **Proven Business Model**: Software reselling has established success patterns [20][23]
4. **Scalable Foundation**: Success here can fund the more complex payment intermediary business later

The software marketplace offers a clearer path to profitability with manageable risk, while the payment intermediary business, though potentially more lucrative, requires substantial regulatory navigation and capital investment [28][29].

Both business models have strong potential, but the software marketplace provides a more accessible entry point into the broader goal of solving payment and access barriers for Bangladeshi entrepreneurs.

















### **Part 1: Market Analysis for Selling GoHighLevel Services**  
---

#### **1. Dubai Real Estate Agencies Market**  
**Market Size & Growth**:  
- **Transaction Value**: AED 76.6B in April 2025 (+89% YoY), driven by land sales (50% of transactions) and off-plan properties (AED 18.8B for flats) [1].  
- **Competition**: Over 1,500 agencies (e.g., Engel & V√∂lkers, Knight Frank) with 20‚Äì200 agents per firm [2].  
- **Digital Adoption**: 60% of agencies use basic CRMs; only 10% use advanced automation (e.g., AI chatbots, omnichannel marketing) [4][5].  

**Pain Points**:  
- **Lead Management**: High competition for quality leads (avg. 22,139 transactions/month) [1].  
- **Client Retention**: Low repeat business due to fragmented follow-ups.  
- **Branding**: Smaller agencies struggle to differentiate in a luxury-dominated market.  

**Opportunity for GoHighLevel**:  
- **Automation**: Streamline lead capture (website forms, WhatsApp), follow-ups, and client onboarding.  
- **White-Labeling**: Allow agencies to brand the platform as their own (critical for boutique firms).  
- **AI Tools**: Integrate property chatbots, automated valuation models (AVMs), and analytics.  

**Challenges**:  
- Saturation of CRM tools (e.g., Property Finder, Bayut).  
- High expectations for Arabic-language support and Dubai-specific templates.  

**Verdict**: **Good to Better**. High demand for automation, but differentiation is key.  

---

#### **2. Private Clinics in Moka, Saudi Arabia (Healthcare Sector)**  
**Market Size & Growth**:  
- **Healthcare GDP**: SAR 151B ($40B) public sector, SAR 45B ($12B) private sector (10% CAGR) [8].  
- **Digital Health**: Saudi‚Äôs Vision 2030 prioritizes AI/telehealth (e.g., Makkah‚Äôs AI-powered diagnostics) [6][7].  
- **Moka Clinics**: Emerging hub for specialized care (e.g., dental, dermatology) with 100+ private clinics.  

**Pain Points**:  
- **Patient Acquisition**: Reliance on word-of-mouth and fragmented digital marketing.  
- **Compliance**: Strict regulations for patient data (e.g., Saudi FDA, NPHIES).  
- **Retention**: Limited tools for appointment reminders, feedback, and loyalty programs.  

**Opportunity for GoHighLevel**:  
- **Unified Platform**: Combine appointment scheduling, SMS/email reminders, and EHR integrations.  
- **Localized Campaigns**: Halal-certified templates for Ramadan promotions or vaccination drives.  
- **Telehealth Add-Ons**: Integrate with Saudi-compliant video conferencing tools.  

**Challenges**:  
- Low tech adoption in smaller clinics.  
- Competition from specialized healthcare CRMs (e.g., Cerner, Epic).  

**Verdict**: **Better to Best**. Growing digitization and Vision 2030 funding create ripe opportunities.
